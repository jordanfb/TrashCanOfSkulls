If you are reading this note sorry for the inconvenience, I am out of the house right now.  I will be back by the next day.  If you are in dire need of me, follow the path through the forest to my workshop and be sure to cut through the forest to the old path.  I have heard some unsettling noises coming from the forest recently.
